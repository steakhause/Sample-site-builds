						Great family movies are not hard to find these days.  It seems companies like Disney and Sony Pictures 
						have found just the right formula to pack the seats for every new release.  Take a pinch of 
						celebrity voice over, a scoop of amazing animation, and simmer in an underdog rising above it all story
						and you have the makings of 90% of the family movies released in recent memory. See one and you have 
						and you have seen them all.  This site is dedicated to the few brave movies that broke that mold. 
						These timeless classics are more than just movies.  They are family events that evoke conversation as 
						well as the imagination.

						</p>
						<p class='movie-des'>
							Flight of the Navigator. Oh, what a lucky kid whose parents or guardians introduce this gem into their world of Sponge Bob and Monster High. Time travel genre flick at it's finest. Kids don't often truly consider the future but this film allows them to witness the massive impact of the passage of time and familial bonds while offering the acute adorableness of squishy alien life forms. Well, one life form anyway. Sci-fi can be adorable, y'all! The fact that this ordinary, random kid who struggles with adolescence and is constantly irritated by his little brother renders him familiar and relatable. The circumstances under which he becomes accidentally involved, however, make him a pseudo hero. Here is a kid who doesn't remember anything about the eight years he spent traveling the universe but must reconcile what he is told about that experience to his memories of his prior life and how those memories approach him in the present day as a considerably aged mother, father, and brother. They are different but the same. He is the same but different. But one glaring truth remains. What you know and what you love matters most even if you don't realize this fact. Max is an alien seemingly incapable of emotion but comes to know and love David to the point that it becomes clear to him (it?) that David needs to be returned to his own time and place so he can realize this for himself. Maybe the result of that experiment is more important than anything else. Just make sure your kids watch the movie, folks. Compliance, indeed.

			<!--Movie Three-->
			<div class='movie'>
				<div class='row'>
					<div class='col-md-3'>
						<figure><img class='poster' src='images/lemony-snicket.jpg' alt='Labyrinth' height='180'></figure>
					</div>
					<div class='col-md-9'>
						<p class='movie-title'>
							<span class='red'>Lemony Snickets</span><small> (2004)</small>
						</p>
						<p class='movie-des'>
							Not all children’s movies have to be bright and cheerful with jolly characters and happy endings. Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events is anything but cheerful and jolly, but the same darkness that provides its unsettling edge also makes it a delightfully enchanting movie for kids of all ages, even the grown up variety. Looking and feeling very Tim Burton-esque, A Series of Unfortunate Events is chock full of weird and wonderful visuals and imagery. The movie is bursting at the seams with special effects, but each one is precisely blended into the story-telling.

			<!--Movie Four-->
			<div class='movie'>
				<div class='row'>
					<div class='col-md-3'>
						<figure><img class='poster' src='images/coraline.jpg' alt='Labyrinth' height='180'></figure>
					</div>
					<div class='col-md-9'>
						<p class='movie-title'>
							<span class='red'>Coraline</span><small> (2009)</small>
						</p>
						<p class='movie-des'>
							“Coraline” lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling. This is a marvelous family story, tapping into all sorts of childhood dreams and nightmares involving Mommy, monsters and heroic youngsters. This eccentric and deliriously inventive fantasy finds stop-motion auteur Henry Selick scaling new heights of ghoulish whimsy, buoyed by a haunting score that works its own macabre magic.  Take care with the audience that you choose for this one.  The dark setting and "other" characters can be quite terrifying to the meek of heart.
